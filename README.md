# MovieRental

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.0.

## Future Todos
1. move all services to facades and make the project able to run without actually using the api just with mock data
2. add bubble charts
3. make the rental grid work for admin view and make it more abstract to be able to use it for different things
4. refactor requests for fetching movies and user rentals
5. move calls to storage services and refactor services to have more business logic for easier usage by components
6. add build process for production and mock builds.

## Development server
Use npm start to run the project
